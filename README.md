hpfeedsrb
=========

This is a small test implementation of the [hpfeeds](https://github.com/rep/hpfeed)
protocol in Ruby. Only `subscribe` is implemented so far, no `publish`.

This is to be considered WORK IN PROGRESS. I wrote this in an async-way because
I wanted to get to know EventMachine and Ruby 1.9 Fibers.
